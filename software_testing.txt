
 1. Importance of Software Testing
- **Prevents costly failures** (like banking system crashes)
- **Ensures software quality** and reliability
- **Protects user data** and security
- **Meets customer requirements** and expectations
- **Saves money** (fixing bugs early is cheaper than after release)

2. Errors vs Defects vs Failures
- **Error**: Human mistake in code (e.g., programmer writes wrong formula)
- **Defect/Bug**: The flaw in software caused by the error
- **Failure**: When the defect actually causes system to malfunction for users

3. Pesticide Paradox Principle
- If you keep using the same tests, they stop finding new bugs
- **Solution**: Regularly update and add new test cases
- **Example**: If you only test login with "admin/admin", you'll miss other login issues

4. Static vs Dynamic Testing
- **Static Testing**: Review code without executing it (code reviews, inspections)
- **Dynamic Testing**: Run the software with test data (unit testing, integration testing)

5. Early Testing in SDLC
- Finding bugs early = **cheaper to fix**
- Requirements testing catches issues before coding even starts
- Prevents accumulation of defects through development phases
