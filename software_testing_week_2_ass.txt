1. Functional vs Non-Functional Testing
Functional Testing - "Does it WORK?"

Tests WHAT the system does

Examples:

Login functionality

Payment processing

Search features

Focus: Requirements and specifications

Non-Functional Testing - "How WELL does it work?"

Tests HOW the system performs

Examples:

Speed (performance testing)

Security (security testing)

User experience (usability testing)

Focus: Quality attributes

2. Unit Testing vs Integration Testing
Unit Testing 🔧

Tests INDIVIDUAL components in isolation

Scope: Single function/method/class

When: During development

Example: Testing a "calculateTax()" function alone

Tools: JUnit, pytest, NUnit

Integration Testing 🔗

Tests how MULTIPLE components work together

Scope: Interfaces between components

When: After unit testing

Example: Testing login + database + session management together

Tools: TestNG, Selenium

3. System Testing 🏗️
Tests the COMPLETE, integrated system

Scope: Entire application

Focus: End-to-end workflows

Example: Testing entire e-commerce checkout process

Goal: Verify system meets all requirements

4. Acceptance Testing ✅
Tests if system meets BUSINESS needs

Performed by: Clients/end-users

Types:

UAT (User Acceptance Testing) - Real users test

BAT (Business Acceptance Testing) - Business team tests

Question: "Is this software ready for production?"

5. Common Non-Functional Testing Types

Load testing - Normal conditions

Stress testing - Extreme conditions

Volume testing - Large data amounts

Security Testing 🔒

Vulnerability scanning

Penetration testing

Authentication testing

Usability Testing 👥

User experience testing

Interface intuitiveness

Accessibility testing

Compatibility Testing 📱

Different browsers/devices

Operating systems

Mobile responsiveness
